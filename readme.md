# BLT’S – Snap Vision – AR Navigation for Indoor & Outdoor Spaces

Snap Vision is a mobile application designed to help users navigate complex indoor and outdoor environments such as university campuses and malls using AR-powered visual guidance. The app uses a combination of GPS, Bluetooth beacons, and AR overlays to provide seamless real-time wayfinding. This project was developed by Team BLT’S for the COS301 Capstone Module at the University of Pretoria.

## 👥 Team Members

### Bahiya Hoosen – Project Manager  
Hey! I’m Bahiya — a code-loving, chaos-wrangling Computer Science student with a flair for turning logic into creativity and bugs into personal vendettas.  
I code, I plan, I color-code task boards like it’s a competitive sport — and still find myself debugging at 2am, whispering “please work” to my IDE.  
Exploring the digital realms one algorithm at a time, powered by curiosity, caffeine, and an ungodly number of browser tabs.

### Lekisha Chetty  
Hi! I'm Lekisha, a curious and motivated BSc Information and Knowledge Systems student who enjoys cracking complex problems and writing code that (usually) behaves itself.  
I’m an avid programmer and enjoy using creative solutions to tackle challenges across different programming languages.  
Whether I’m debugging mysterious errors or learning a new tech stack, I love the process of continuous growth.

### Tishana Reddy  
Hi! I'm a third-year BSc Computer Science student at the University of Pretoria. I’m passionate about solving real-world problems and I love working on projects that mix creativity with code.  
For Snap Vision, I’ve been hands-on with all sorts of things—from brainstorming features to debugging (and re-debugging) things that worked five minutes ago. I enjoy learning as I go, building cool things with my team, and occasionally shouting "it works!" at my screen.  
Let’s build something awesome!

### Thuwayba Dawood  
As a computer science student, I strongly believe in the importance of critical thinking skills, creative problem solving and attention to detail.  
Through my experience thus far, I have been able to work with multiple programming languages. This has allowed me to solve complex problems through unique solutions.  
I believe that collaboration with others is key to improving my own understanding of the world of computer science, both within university and beyond.

### Saalihah Sacoor  
Hey there, Saalihah here!  
I'm a CS student who loves solving problems, delving into the programming world and occasionally wondering why my program works when it really shouldn't.  
When I'm not wrangling code in front of a dimly lit screen, you'll find me trying to reconnect with nature doing a 5k run at sunrise or strategizing on the netball court.

## Git Structure

### Branching Strategy  
We follow the **Gitflow branching model** to manage the development and release process effectively. The main branches are:  
- **`main`**: Contains production-ready code.  
- **`dev`**: Integrates all development changes.  
- **`feature/*`**: Used for developing new features.  
- **`hotfix/*`**: Used for critical bug fixes.
